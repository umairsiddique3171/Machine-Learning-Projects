# celebrity_images_classification
This repository contains the source code of the project focused on training different Machine Learning models using GridSearchCV for recognizing different celebrities faces. Data was taken from google images using fatcun chrome extension. I created filter_face_module along the way which takes images from directories and create new directories with cropped faces by using opencv harcascade classifier for face and eyes (https://github.com/umairsiddique3171/filter_face_module.git). This project involve several preprocessing techniques such as resizing, BGR2GRAY, normalization,etc. Evaluation was done using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix.
