# pneumonia_detection_from_chest_x-rays_images
This repository contains the source code of the project focused on training different Machine Learning models using GridSearchCV for pneumonia detection from chest x-rays images. Most probable classification criteria is that patients with pneumonia have foggy images of exposing lungs unclearly due to bacteria clogging where as normal patients have x-rays images with organs clearly visible. Medical Specialists also mostly use this criteria for classification. Several Preprocessing techniques were applied to the data such as Image Resizing (224,224), Gray Scale Conversion, GaussainBlur and CLAHE (Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization).

This project is the part of more complex project which involves detecting and counting empty parking spots (https://github.com/umairsiddique3171/pneumonia_detection_from_chest_x-rays_images_web_app_using_scikit-learn_and_streamlit.git).
