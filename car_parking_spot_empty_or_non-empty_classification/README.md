# car_parking_spot_empty_or_non-empty_classification
This repository contains the project source code focused on training different Machine Learning models using GridSearchCV for classifying car parking spot as empty or non-empty. This project is the part of more complex project which involves detecting and counting empty parking spots (https://github.com/umairsiddique3171/parking_spot_detector_and_counter_using_opencv_and_scikit-learn.git). Data for this project is also uploaded in this github repository.
