# rock_vs_mine_prediction_using_sonar_data
This repository contains the source code of the project focused on training different Machine Learning models using GridSearchCV for classifying rock and mine underwater based on sonar data. Several Preprocessing techniques were applied to the data such as EDA, normalization, etc.

Machine learning models trained on sonar data can help submarines avoid potential hazards by accurately detecting underwater obstacles, such as rocks or mines, in their path. By analyzing the sonar signals, these models can provide real-time warnings to submarine operators, allowing them to navigate safely and avoid collisions. This technology enhances submarine safety, reduces the risk of accidents, and ensures the protection of both crew and vessel during underwater operations.

Data for this project is also attached in this repo.
