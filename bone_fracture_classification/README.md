# bone_fracture_classification
This repository contains the project source code focused on training different Machine Learning models using GridSearchCV for bone fracture classification. Several Preprocessing techniques were applied to the data such as GaussainBlur, CLAHE (Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and Canny Edge Detection. This project was based on research paper which is also attached in this github repo. And almost same results were produced,as mentioned in research paper,while coding from scratch.
Data for this project can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays
