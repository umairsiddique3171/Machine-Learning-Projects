# customer_segmentation
This repository contains the source code of the project focused on training K-Means clustering algorithm for customers segmenation of the Big Mart. Mart data contained gender, age, annual income and spending score of the customers. And based on that we tried to do customer segmentation. Several Preprocessing techniques were applied to the data such as EDA,label encoding,etc. WCCS (Within Clusters Sum of Squares) approach was used to decide the optimum number of clusters with the help of elbow point graph. At the end, visualization was done to see the segmented customers classes. Data for this project is also attached in this repo.
