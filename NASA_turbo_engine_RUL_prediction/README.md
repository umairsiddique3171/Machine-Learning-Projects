# nasa_turbo_engine_rul_prediction
This is my code from my Machine Learning internship, where I predicted NASA engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL). I created functions and classes for data analysis and feature selection, useful in later projects. I achieved around 65% accuracy, and I believe it can improve with different models and more data.
